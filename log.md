## Day 2: Saturday, January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed about 40 challenges, quite a feat, haha. I was accepted into the freeCodeCamp facebook group in my area and am planning on possibly participating in one of their events.

**Thoughts**: I learned more about HTML, which is the language(?) that I am learning by using the challenges on freeCodeCamp's website. There were quite a few things... which include form elements, like radio buttons and checkboxes, as well as things like different codes for RGB color values (additive and subtractive values, woot!). I also learned about the body element, padding and margins, and the CSS hierarchy thingy (prioritizing and overriding). I am extremely pleased with my progress. These challenges are fun!
